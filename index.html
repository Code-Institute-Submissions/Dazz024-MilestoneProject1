                    Recently having invested in the latest technology on our workout machines we have got not only one of the most modern gyms around 
                    but also one of the smartest. We have just received a refurbishment that is a must see. We make working out fun again! From rowing machines 
                    that really make you feel like you're out in open water racing against Olympians to being able to run on a treadmill in a giant crowd of 
                    people through the streets of London for the London Marathon while having Mo Farah right there to help you out and motivate you the whole way. 
                    Yes that's right we got some of the greatest athletes in our games to help you pushyourself to be the best and most motivated version of yourself 
                    you can possibly be.

                    In our gyms we always make sure all of our members are always well taken care of. We provide a certified first aider on the premise 
                    at all times. We make sure that when you’re trying your very hardest to shred off those calories or tone up those abs, that you’ve always 
                    got someone on hand or within a speed dial away to help you out if an injury or cardiovascular issue rears its ugly head. We also have the best 
                    equipment to keep even the clumsiest of us safe from the soft but firm mat floor  tactically placed throughout the gym, to the extra safety 
                    features on each of our machines in case you bite more than you can chew. Just know we’ve got you covered and you’re in good hands. No matter 
                    if you’re young or old, injury prone or not, we have all the necessary equipment to keep you guys safe and make sure nobody hurts each other. 
                    Gyms can be a very dangerous place when the equipment is not used responsibly. We have a number of stretches 
                    <a href="https://blog.wantable.com/essential-pre-post-workout-stretches/">here</a> if you want to know more ways to keep yourself safe.
