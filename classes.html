                        Yoga is an ancient form of exercise that focuses on strength, flexibility and breathing to boost physical and mental wellbeing. The main components of 
                        yoga are postures (a series of movements designed to increase strength and flexibility) and breathing. The practice originated in India about 5,000 years 
                        ago and has been adapted in other countries in a variety of ways. Yoga is now commonplace in leisure centres, health clubs, schools, hospitals and surgeries.
                        Dozens of scientific trials of varying quality have been published on yoga. While there's scope for more rigorous studies on its health benefits, most 
                        studies suggest yoga is a safe and effective way to increase physical activity, especially strength, flexibility and balance. There's some evidence that 
                        regular yoga practice is beneficial for people with high blood pressure, heart disease, aches and pains – including lower back pain – depression and stress.

                        CrossFit is a lifestyle characterized by safe, effective exercise and sound nutrition. CrossFit can be used to accomplish any goal, from improved 
                        health to weight loss to better performance. The program works for everyone — people who are just starting out and people who have trained for years.
                        The magic is in the movement. CrossFit workouts are different every day and can be modified to help each athlete achieve their goals. The workouts may 
                        be adapted for people at any age and level of fitness. Different every day, CrossFit workouts are tailored to the individual. CrossFit uses safe, effective, 
                        and efficient movements similar to those you use every day in life. In CrossFit workouts, intensity levels are adjusted to challenge the individual and safely 
                        improve fitness.

                        A typical circuit training workout includes about 8-10 exercise stations. After completing a station, instead of resting, you move quickly to the next 
                        station. A muscular strength and endurance circuit alternates muscle groups, such as upper body, lower body and core, so little or no rest is needed in 
                        between stations. This article focuses on another form of circuit training: aerobic + strength. This type of circuit alternates 1-2 sets of resistance 
                        exercise (body weight, free weights, dumbbells, kettle bells, bands, etc.), with brief bouts of cardiovascular exercise (jogging in place, stationary 
                        cycling, rowing, etc.) lasting anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes. Depending on your goals and the number of circuit stations, you can complete 1 or 
                        more circuits in a 30-60 minute session.
