# Milestone Project 1 - Superfit Gym
This is a website which shows off what Superfit Gym has to offer. It shows many things such as their facilities, their wide variety of classes which you can take advantage of, 
videos and photos to show the facilities and people taking advantage of the fantastic facility and lastly, shows off the number of personal trainers and staff members we have to 
support you and our location and how to get to us or make contact with us.
